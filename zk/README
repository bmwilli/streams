Inspecting Zookeeper for Streams Resource Manager Development:
-------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to get auths from Streams:

/opt/ibm/InfoSphere_Streams/4.2.0.0/java/bin/java -cp /opt/ibm/InfoSphere_Streams/4.2.0.0/system/impl/lib/com.ibm.streams.platform.jar com.ibm.streams.management.persistence.Permission StreamsDomain


Run zkCli.sh

Paste the auth commands from above into command line


Use two windows is easiest.
In one window issue ls commands, then when you get to a node you want to see copy into other window where you have get commands

Example path for Streams Mesos Resource Manager:

/com.ibm.im.streams.resourcemgr/mesos/domains/StreamsDomain/state/resources

Resource manager path is removed when resource manager is stopped
